## Interpret Regression Results

-   Reviewing DUI fatality problem results
    -   as the beer tax increases by +1 dollar per case, the fatalities per 100k people decreases by **1.041**
    -   the asterisk in -1.041\*\*\* indicate that the p-value is very small (p\<0.01), so the result is significant at the 1% level
    -   standard error for the -1.04 slope is below it in parenthesis, 0.376
-   the larger the standard error, the larger the interval (?) so you cannot reject the null
-   slope
    -   point estimate
    -   size of estimation (?)
-   precision
    -   p-value tells you about rejecting/accepting the nukk
    -   standard error tells you about how precisely you've estimated
-   Note

## Fixed-Effect Model

-   get rid of ${\alpha}_i$ by using the within cariation in the data
